Since 2022 (while amidst finishing the Coronavirus pandemic) I was invited into a Dungeons and Dragons campaign by the sister of a friend. Thus began one of the longest collaborative writing projects I currently have and my exploration journey for writing and investigating. 

We've played the same campaign (after inviting some more friends to the group) ever since, reuniting whenever we can on weekends and playing during hours. Mostly virtually, given how some participants are residing in other countries. Its also thanks to this main project that I learned some web development (HTLM, Markdown, LaTex, etc.), basing this CV and the DnD wiki on the "Digital Garden" open source project. 

As I mentioned before, I also began working on some stories of my own and investigating into the different subject that each story touches. Mainly basing myself on the lives of some of my closest friends. I talk to them about their experiences and investigate on my own the locations, events and/or nuances about and around them. From their jobs to the context behind the scenes that conform their lives.
