One of the two "honor badge" (meaning one directly sponsored by the *Tecnologico de Monterrey)* projects I've worked on and my first approach to robotics as a concept. Lebotics is a high school team participating annually on the FIRST tournaments (regionally and nationally) under the team number 5948. While participating in the national championship (first half of 2022. I initially took the programming side of the project; working under a senior in "Computer Science" I began editing the Github repository of the team. Although soon I'd find that I worked better and more comfortably while directly influencing the robot. So I ended up the captain of Electronics and Programming (with much help of my dev senior), and went to Tecnologico de Monterrey Campus MTY to support y team from the gallows and in the pits. I even appeared in some photos from the "Conecta Tec" article below.

Here's the team socials for checking out their newest work (some of the photos from my year have been deleted).

Finally, my longest apportation to the team was as a senior for the next generation of Lebotics. Not only mentoring the new members of programming and electronics, but mainly focusing on the efforts towards gaining the "Chariman's Award". In said efforts I gave classes during a semester in the cultural center "Fidel VelÃ¡zquez" near campus. Sponsored by the IMSS (*Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social*), a mentor coworker and I built and imparted a syllabus to an introduction to robotics. Covering "Sensors and Actuators", "Basic Block and Arduino programming", "Lego Mindstorms Sumo" and "Applications in Industry".
