The Iktan Rover Project was the second "honor badge" project I was in. As a team conformed by only undergrads; we not only furthered our possible interests but also entered the team yearning to learn more about fields of interest and certain applicable technologies, softwares or algorithms. As such, my participation in the telemetry field was what finally pushed me over the edge towards robotics (rather than computer sciences); but since I already was a CS major I ended up learning front/backend and then fully developing into the electronic/programming/data gathering from the telemetry modules. Said modules used PCBs of my design alongside programming from the team. Although, the bigger PCB suffered some accidents which made it end up in a phenolic plate (although with the same design). All electroncis were handled in Proteus, but I also ended up learning the basics for KiCad. 

While in the telemetry team, I ended up also helping the tool design team. By giving ideas and then designing (first in TinkerCAD then in Solidworks) for the Sample Carrier. Although my design was ultimately not the one used, not only did it help develop the final design (that kept the idea of the large vials in the back) but also helped me to understand extended reality uses and solidwork CAD design.
