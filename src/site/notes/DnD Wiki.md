A Dungeons & Dragons Campaign hosted and mainly written by me. That, albeit very slowly thanks to school, has been going on and off for almost a year and a half. During which we've played around 24 hours in total. The totality of the web page was made by me; by learning LaTex, Markdown and other HTML or web dev languages. Also thanks to "Obsidian Digital Garden" community project for helping me upload my page onto a vercel app.
