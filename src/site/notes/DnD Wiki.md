A Dungeons & Dragons Campaign hosted and mainly written by me. That, albeit  slowly, has been going on and off for a year and a half. During which my group and I have played around 24 hours in total. The totality of the web page was made by me; by learning LaTex, Markdown and other HTML or web dev languages. Also with the "Obsidian Digital Garden" community project, which is how I publish some works freely. It uses a github repository as the backend and a vercel app display for the frontend.
