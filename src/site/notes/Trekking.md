From an early age, I demonstrated a natural inclination toward exploration and adventure; traits my family recognized from the moment I began walking. This inherent curiosity and active disposition characterized my formative years, though it necessarily receded during my initial university period when academic commitments demanded considerable time and focus. Relocating to Monterrey to continue my studies marked a significant turning point in this regard. The city's proximity to the Sierra Madre mountains and its diverse natural surroundings rekindled my longstanding passion for outdoor exploration. This transition represented not merely a change of academic setting, but a reconnection with fundamental aspects of my character that had been temporarily set aside.

Since establishing myself in Monterrey, I have actively pursued opportunities to explore notable natural landscapes across Mexico, the United Kingdom, and every destination that allows or encourages such activities. My explorations have encompassed the forests and canyon systems surrounding Mexico City (Ajusco, Dinamos, etc.), Monterrey (Sierra Madre, Chipinque, Rio Ramos, Pico Sur, etc.), and Querétaro (Sierra Gorda, Cañon Paraíso), each presenting distinct geological features and challenges. These Mexican expeditions provided valuable experience navigating diverse terrains, from arid canyon environments to temperate highland forests. My pursuit of outdoor experiences extended internationally as well, including treks through the volcanic landscapes surrounding Edinburgh and visits to the renowned white cliffs of Dover. These varied expeditions have reinforced an important principle: exploration serves not only as physical exercise but as a means of continuous personal development, challenging myself to venture beyond established comfort zones and embrace unfamiliar environments with adaptability and determination. 

Aside from the physical and mental challenge, this hobby has allowed me to venture into different (previously unexplored) abilities of mine. I've had the opportunity to certify myself in first aid with my local Red Cross, learned to better orientate myself and explore safely. Also, taken clases, and a great interest, into climbing and rappel thanks to Tec's co-curriculum classes.
