In my third semester I began my separation from the common avenue of ICT (*Ingeniería en Computación y Tecnologías de Información*). As my last project in said avenue, my team and I proposed a self regulating and controlling system to prevent leaks as well as fires. It was intended for the use in home environments, so it also checked the water for any change in pH indicating contamination in water. I was in charge of the backend, frontend (in the form of an app that could receive data and send pings to close and open the servo-motor controlled key), and lastly we developed the software inside three nodemcus (esp8666) between the team.
