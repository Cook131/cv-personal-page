 I spent my first semester in campus MTY coaching a team participating in the FTC FIRST challenge on behalf of the [Voltec](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=503291271796434&set=a.503291228463105) team. The team was composed of only middle to junior high schoolers, and they were divided in two teams. Both teams worked on activities designing their own robots and even began building prototypes for mechanisms they wanted to implement with spare pieces from the teams laboratory. Unfortunately as the year advanced many people stoped coming; so at the end we ended up helping them build and program the chassis of an actual FRC (high school level) robot with swerve wheels between all the participants left. At the end I even got to write a letter of recommendation for future programs and even an entrance to Tec to some kids that really called our attention and that of Voltec's General Coach.
